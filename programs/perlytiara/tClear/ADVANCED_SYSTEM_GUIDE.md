## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Hardware Requirements

**Computer (Master Controller):**
- ComputerCraft computer
- Wireless modem
- Monitor (optional, for better interface)

**Mining Turtle:**
- Advanced mining turtle
- Wireless modem
- Pickaxe (or other mining tool)
- Fuel (coal, charcoal, etc.)

**Chunky Turtle:**
- Wireless turtle
- Wireless modem
- No tools required
- Fuel (coal, charcoal, etc.)

### Step 2: Placement

```
[Chunky] [Mining] ‚Üê Start here
   ‚Üì        ‚Üì
  Turtle   Turtle
```

1. Place the **mining turtle** at the left corner of your desired mining area
2. Place the **chunky turtle** one block to the **right** of the mining turtle
3. Both turtles should be at the **same height** and **facing the same direction**
4. Ensure both turtles have wireless modems attached

### Step 3: Software Installation

Copy the following files to the appropriate devices:

**On the Computer:**
- `AdvancedMiningController.lua`

**On the Mining Turtle:**
- `AdvancedMiningTurtle.lua`

**On the Chunky Turtle:**
- `AdvancedChunkyTurtle.lua`

### Step 4: Get Device IDs

On each device, run:
```lua
print(os.getComputerID())
```

Note down all three IDs:
- Computer ID
- Mining Turtle ID  
- Chunky Turtle ID

## üéÆ Usage Guide

### Quick Start

1. **Start the Chunky Turtle:**
   ```lua
   AdvancedChunkyTurtle
   ```
   The chunky turtle will display "Waiting for pairing with master turtle..."

2. **Start the Mining Turtle:**
   ```lua
   AdvancedMiningTurtle
   ```
   The mining turtle will display "Waiting for controller commands..."

3. **Start the Master Controller:**
   ```lua
   AdvancedMiningController
   ```
   Follow the on-screen prompts to:
   - Discover and select turtles
   - Configure mining parameters
   - Start the operation

### Operation Parameters

**Basic Parameters:**
- **Depth**: How far forward to mine (must be ‚â• 1)
- **Width**: How wide to mine (cannot be -1, 0, or 1)
- **Height**: How tall to mine (cannot be 0)

**Advanced Options:**
- `layerbylayer` - Mine one layer at a time (safer for lava)
- `startwithin` - Start inside the mining area
- `stripmine` - Use for strip mining operations

### Example Commands

```lua
# Basic mining operation
Depth: 10
Width: 5
Height: 3
Options: (none)

# Safe mining with layer-by-layer
Depth: 20
Width: 8
Height: 4
Options: layerbylayer

# Strip mining
Depth: 50
Width: -2
Height: 3
Options: stripmine layerbylayer
```

## üìä Monitoring and Control

### Real-time Monitoring

During operation, you can:
- Press `s` for status updates
- Press `p` to pause the operation
- Press `r` to resume the operation
- Press `q` to quit monitoring (operation continues)

### Status Information

The system provides real-time information about:
- Current position of mining turtle
- Mining progress
- Fuel levels
- Inventory status
- Chunky turtle status

## üîß Advanced Features

### Automatic Discovery

The system automatically discovers available turtles on the network:
- Scans for mining turtles
- Scans for chunky turtles
- Displays fuel and inventory information
- Allows selection of specific turtles

### Error Handling

**Mining Turtle:**
- Automatic fuel management
- Movement retry logic
- Error reporting to controller
- Graceful operation shutdown

**Chunky Turtle:**
- Movement failure recovery
- Digging when blocked
- Retry logic for failed movements
- Status reporting

### Communication Protocols

The system uses multiple communication protocols:
- `advanced-mining` - Main control protocol
- `tclear-chunky` - Chunky turtle specific protocol
- Automatic fallback to legacy protocols

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No mining turtles found"**
- Ensure mining turtle is running `AdvancedMiningTurtle.lua`
- Check wireless modem is attached and working
- Verify both devices are on the same network

**"No chunky turtles found"**
- Ensure chunky turtle is running `AdvancedChunkyTurtle.lua`
- Check wireless modem is attached and working
- Operation can continue without chunky turtle (not recommended)

**"No modem found"**
- Attach a wireless modem to the device
- Ensure modem is properly connected
- Check modem is not damaged

**Chunky turtle not following**
- Check rednet communication between turtles
- Restart both turtles if needed
- Verify turtle IDs are correct
- Check for obstacles blocking chunky turtle

**Mining turtle breaks during operation**
- This should not happen with chunky pairing
- Check that chunky turtle is actually following
- Ensure chunk loading signals are being sent
- Verify both turtles have adequate fuel

### Debug Mode

To enable debug output, edit the respective script files:
```lua
local blnDebugPrint = true
```

### Manual Recovery

If the system fails:
1. Stop all devices (Ctrl+T)
2. Restart chunky turtle first: `AdvancedChunkyTurtle`
3. Restart mining turtle: `AdvancedMiningTurtle`
4. Restart controller: `AdvancedMiningController`

## üìà Performance Tips

### Optimal Placement
- Place chunky turtle exactly one block to the right of mining turtle
- Ensure clear path for chunky turtle to follow
- Avoid placing near lava or dangerous areas
- Keep both turtles at the same height

### Fuel Management
- Keep both turtles well-fueled
- Monitor fuel levels during operation
- Have backup fuel ready
- Use efficient fuel sources (coal, charcoal)

### Network Optimization
- Ensure good wireless signal strength
- Avoid interference from other wireless devices
- Keep devices within reasonable range
- Use wired modems for long-distance operations

## üîí Safety Considerations

### Operation Safety
- Always test in a safe area first
- Monitor the operation, especially for large excavations
- Keep backup fuel for both turtles
- Ensure adequate inventory space

### Turtle Safety
- The chunky turtle is vulnerable while following
- Protect chunky turtle from mobs
- Avoid dangerous areas (lava, void, etc.)
- Keep both turtles fueled and maintained

### Emergency Procedures
- Press Ctrl+T on any device to stop
- Both turtles will stop safely
- Manual recovery procedures available
- System can be restarted after issues
