   - Automatically deploys on push to `main` branch
   - Can be manually triggered
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages

2. **`programs/perlytiara/Mastermine/.github-pages-template.html`** - Web interface template
   - Beautiful landing page for browsing files
   - Installation instructions
   - Feature list and links

3. **`programs/perlytiara/Mastermine/DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete deployment guide
   - Setup instructions
   - Troubleshooting
   - Advanced options

4. **`programs/perlytiara/Mastermine/GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md`** - Quick reference guide
   - 3-step setup process
   - Usage examples
   - Pro tips

5. **`.gitignore`** (root) - Build artifacts exclusion

## 🚀 How to Deploy (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
4. Save

### Step 2: Push Your Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment for Mastermine"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- Visit the **Actions** tab
- Watch the workflow run (takes ~2 minutes)
- Once complete, your files are live! ✨

## 🌐 Your Deployed URLs

After deployment, files will be available at:

```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/Mastermine/
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/Mastermine/mastermine.lua
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/Mastermine/hub.lua
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/Mastermine/turtle.lua
etc...
```

**Important:** Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!

## 🐢 Player Installation

Once deployed, players can install Mastermine in ComputerCraft with:

```lua
wget https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/Mastermine/mastermine.lua
mastermine.lua disk
disk/hub.lua
```

## 📦 What Gets Deployed

The deployment includes:

### Main Files:
- ✅ `mastermine.lua` - The bundled installer (self-extracting archive)
- ✅ `hub.lua` - Hub computer setup script
- ✅ `turtle.lua` - Turtle initialization script  
- ✅ `pocket.lua` - Pocket computer setup script
- ✅ `README.md` - Documentation
- ✅ `LICENSE` - MIT License

### Individual Files (for advanced users):
- ✅ `hub_files/` - All hub computer files
- ✅ `turtle_files/` - All turtle operation files
- ✅ `pocket_files/` - All pocket computer files

### Bonus:
- ✅ `index.html` - Beautiful web interface for browsing

## 🔄 How Auto-Deployment Works

1. **You edit files** in `programs/perlytiara/Mastermine/`
2. **You push to GitHub** → `git push origin main`
3. **GitHub Actions triggers** automatically
4. **Workflow builds** the deployment in `_site/Mastermine/`
5. **GitHub Pages publishes** the files
6. **Files are accessible** via HTTPS instantly!

The whole process takes about 1-2 minutes after pushing.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Works with `wget`** - Downloads work exactly like GitHub raw files
- ✅ **No rate limits** - Unlike Pastebin
- ✅ **Automatic deployment** - Push and forget
- ✅ **Clean URLs** - No ugly GitHub raw URLs
- ✅ **Web interface** - Players can browse files in a browser
- ✅ **Fast and reliable** - Hosted on GitHub's CDN
- ✅ **Version control** - Easy rollbacks via Git

## 🎯 Benefits Over Pastebin

| Feature | GitHub Pages | Pastebin |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Rate limits | None | Yes (restrictive) |
| File organization | Folders | Single files |
| Auto-updates | Yes | Manual |
| Version history | Full Git history | Limited |
| Custom domain | Yes | No |
| Cost | Free | Free (limited) |

## 📝 Next Steps

1. ✅ Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. ✅ Push this commit to trigger first deployment
3. ✅ Wait for deployment to complete (~2 mins)
4. ✅ Test the URL in a browser
5. ✅ Update your YouTube videos with the new installation method!

## 🔧 Updating the Deployment

Just edit files and push! The workflow automatically:
1. Detects changes in `programs/perlytiara/Mastermine/`
2. Rebuilds the deployment
3. Publishes updates to GitHub Pages

Changes typically go live within 1-2 minutes.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Update Your README
Replace the Pastebin instructions with:

```markdown
## Quick Install

In ComputerCraft, run:
```lua
wget https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/Mastermine/mastermine.lua
mastermine.lua disk
disk/hub.lua
```
```

### Share Your URL
- Add it to video descriptions
- Pin it in YouTube comments
- Share it in Discord servers
- Update mod pack documentation

### Monitor Usage
- Check **Insights** → **Traffic** to see downloads (if available)
- Watch **Actions** tab for deployment status
- Get notifications for failed deployments

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed
- Check the **Actions** tab for errors
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
- Verify file paths are correct

### Files Not Accessible
- Wait a few minutes (first deployment can take ~5 mins)
- Clear browser cache
- Check that the deployment completed successfully

### `wget` Not Working in ComputerCraft
- Verify HTTP is enabled in CC:Tweaked config
- Check URL is correct (case-sensitive!)
- Test URL in browser first
