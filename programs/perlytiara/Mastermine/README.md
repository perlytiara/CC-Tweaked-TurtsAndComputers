# Mastermine
A fully automated strip mining network for ComputerCraft turtles!

Here's all the code for anyone who is interested! Check out the tutorial below for installation instructions.

Also, here are steps for a quick install via pastebin:

1. Place your advanced computer next to a disk drive with a blank disk in.
2. Run `pastebin get CtcSGkpc mastermine.lua`
3. Run `mastermine disk`
4. Run `disk/hub.lua`

## Play with or without Peripherals:

I highly recommend using the a peripherals mod with chunky turtles, but upon popular request I added the ability to disable the need for chunky turtle pairs. Just go to the config and set `use_chunky_turtles = false`

## Troubleshooting:

After having some chats with folks it seems like there are some common pitfalls within the turtle setup. If you're getting weird behavior I suggest taking a look at this list before posting an issue. Otherwise, please let me know your problem and we can take a look together.

* ***GPS has an incorrect coordinate.*** There are 4 computers in the GPS setup, each with an x, y, and z coordinate. If any of these numbers are entered wrong the GPS will act funky and nothing will work. A good way to test it's working is to enter `gps locate` into any rednet enabled computer or turtle and verify the answer.
* ***Mine entrance has an incorrect y value.*** Similarly, the position of `mine_entrance` is essential, and must have the correct y value of the block directly above the ground (same as the disk drive in the videos). If the y value is off, I don't quite know what will happen.
* ***Turtles are more than 8 blocks away from the mine entrance.*** Turtles have to be within the `control room area` when they are above ground, otherwise they will get lost and end up in `halt` mode. So if your disk drive is 9 or more blocks away from the entrance, the turtles will just sit there not doing anything after you initialize them. The `control_room_area` field in the `hub_files/config.lua` file is adjustable to fit whatever size you need. **Note:** If you have a large number of turtles you may need to increase the control room area to fit a larger turtle parking area.
* ***Your downloaded program is not up to date.*** Some things, such as compatibility with the new Advanced Peripherals mod, are newer additions and might not exist in the older code. I apologize that there aren't version numbers, I maybe should have a whole releases section but I haven't gotten that far yet. I wasn't expecting such a need for updates. Anyways, you might want to re-download the program periodically, just remember to preserve your config file somehow.

Hopefully that covers a lot of it. Again, lemme know if you still can't get the thing to work.

## User commands:

* `on/go`
* `off/stop`
* `turtle <#> <action>`
* `update <#>`
* `reboot <#>`
* `shutdown <#>`
* `reset <#>`
* `clear <#>`
* `halt <#>`
* `return <#>`
* `hubupdate`
* `hubreboot`
* `hubshutdown`


use `*` as notation for all turtles

## Floppy disk limit:

There's a built in limit in computer craft for how much data a floppy disk can store, and as it happens Mastermine is bigger. There are two solutions for dealing with this.
1. The size of floppy disks can be increased in the mod's config file, assuming you have access to that (this is the preferred option).
2. There are a number of reasons one might not be able to edit the config file, so there is a second, workaround-y option in which the data isn't fully stored on the disk. To do it, start with the regular computer + monitor + modem + disk drive + floppy disk setup, and then enter the following into the hub computer:

       pastebin get CtcSGkpc mastermine.lua
       mkdir files
       mastermine files
       mv files/hub_files/* .
       mv files/turtle_files disk
       mv files/turtle.lua disk
       reboot
       
   After this you should be able to add turtles to the system as usual. The only downside is that you will not be able to update the hub from the disk. All of the hub files will be local. This means the process for editing the config file is slightly different, in that you need to edit the config.lua file on the hub rather than on the disk.
